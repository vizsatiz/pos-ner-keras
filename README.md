# Summary

The project is about creating a POS and NER tagging model using a Keras model.
The the tagging is done using stanford stanza library.
 [standford/stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) 
The idea is to further improve the model using transform learning and create a tensorflow lite model.
